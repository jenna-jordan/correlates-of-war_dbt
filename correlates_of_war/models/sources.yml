Wars have been categorized by whether they primarily take place between/among states, between/among a state(s) and a nonstate entity, and within states. This dataset encompasses wars in the middle category – wars that take place between a state(s) and a nonstate entity outside the borders of the state... An extra-state war involves fighting by a state system member outside its borders against the armed forces of an entity that is not a member of the interstate system. Within the current COW war typology, an extra-state war must meet same definitional requirements of all wars in that the war must involve sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a twelve month period."

        description: "The Correlates of War (COW) Project has utilized a classification of wars that is based upon the status of territorial entities, in particular focusing on those that are classified as members of the inter-state system (referred to as “states”).3 Wars have been categorized by whether they primarily take place between/among states, between/among a state(s) and a non-state entity, and within states. This dataset encompasses wars in this last category – wars that predominantly take place within the recognized territory of a state, or intra-state war... Within the COW war typology, an intra-state war must meet same definitional requirements of all wars in that the war must involve sustained combat, involving organized armed forces, resulting in a minimum of 1,000 battle-related combatant fatalities within a twelve-month period. When Correlates of War scholars Melvin Small and J. David Singer first extended their study of war to include intra-state wars in Resort to Arms, they established an additional requisite condition that for a conflict to be a war, it must involve armed forces capable of “effective resistance” on both sides. They then developed two alternative criteria for defining effective resistance: “(a) both sides had to be initially organized for violent conflict and prepared to resist the attacks of their antagonists, or (b) the weaker side, although initially unprepared, is able to inflict upon the stronger opponents at least five percent of the number of fatalities it sustains.”4 These effective resistance criteria were specifically utilized to differentiate wars from massacres, one-sided state killings, or general riots by unorganized individuals. Such one-sided violence is not considered to be the same phenomenon as war and is not included here.... Overall, there is one record for a war. The number assigned to the war (WarNum) may have a value that contains decimal value (e.g. 502.1). The decimal values were used as a means to enter the large number of new wars while maintaining the numbering of previous versions of the data. It in no way implies that these wars are subsidiary wars. The war’s primary participants are listed as having fought on Side A or Side B of the war. The letters A and B have no particular meaning, though in civil wars the state government is listed as Side A."

        description: "Previously, the Correlates of War (COW) Project has examined only wars that involved the government of a member of the interstate system (a state) in one form or another. The inclusion of non-state wars in the data presented here represents an attempt to broaden our understanding of war by including wars between or among non-state entities. Such entities include governments of other types of geopolitical units (GPUs), such as dependencies or non-state autonomous entities, that do not meet the criteria of system membership. They also might involve nonterritorial entities (NTEs) or non-state armed groups (NSAs) that have no defined territorial base. From a state-centric theoretical perspective, wars between or among non-state actors fall into four general categories... Two of these types take place within existing system members--regional internal wars (war type 6) and inter-communal wars (war type 7)--and thus are included along with civil wars in the broader category of intra-state wars. The remaining two classifications, wars between or among non-state entities that take place in non-state territory (war type 8, of which we have sixty-one) and wars between NSAs that take place across state borders (war type 9, of which we have identified one), are included in the Non-State War dataset presented here... Since non-state armed groups are generally smaller than states and have fewer resources than states, we have adopted a more minimalist requirement for an NSA to be considered a war participant. An NSA can be considered a war participant if it either commits 100 armed personnel to the war or suffers 25 battle-related deaths. Thus non-state wars involve combat between two or more non-state armed groups that are organized for combat, are capable of effective resistance, and commit a minimum of 100 troops to the war or suffer 25 battle-related deaths. Admittedly, this lower level to qualify as a war participant may make it more complicated to identify all of the participants in a non-state war. The participants are grouped as to whether they fought on Side A or Side B of the war (the letters A and B having no particular meaning)."
